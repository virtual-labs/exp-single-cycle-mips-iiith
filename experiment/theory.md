1 In Single Cycle CPU design approach each instruction takes exactly one clock cycle to execute.  
2 In Multicycle CPU each instruction multiple clock cycles to execute.  
3 In Pipelined approach instruction execution takes place in a overlapped fashion.  
4 The instructions supported by the Single Cycle cpu in our experiment and how to microcode new instructions are all given as a part of the experiment itself.
